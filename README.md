hi,
for the sovonvogelonderzoek in the Netherlands,
we always use a blooklet to fill in the things.
but thats unhandy because of rain ect.
so ive been building a website.
this is mostly the front-end of the website, with a simpje node.js server
you can put this on your own domain i reckon. 
it had 3 buttons

save to excel (youll get an excel file with the data from that week
save (itll be saved to an database
  you need to link this yourself. I dont have a data base
clear fields (this is to clear all the fields.


(the just "sovon" files are the new, and the best ones)

hopefully this is enough information for everyone :)
